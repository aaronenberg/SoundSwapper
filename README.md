# Sound Swapper
Allows the user to replace any sound effect.

To replace a sound, add its ID to the list in the plugin menu, then place a .wav file with the same name in the
SoundSwapper folder in your root RuneLite folder. The plugin will grab the sound and use it instead!

E.g. *157,205,550* -> place *157.wav*, *205.wav*, and *550.wav* in the SoundSwapper folder in your RuneLite folder.

To find Sound IDs, you can check https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/List_of_in-game_sound_IDs or use the Visual Sounds
Plugin on the hub.
